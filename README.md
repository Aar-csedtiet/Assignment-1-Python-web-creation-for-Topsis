    c. The decision matrix is normalized to bring all criteria to a common scale.
    d. Normalized values are multiplied by their respective weights.
    e. Ideal best and ideal worst values are identified based on the impacts.
    f. Euclidean distances from the ideal best and worst are calculated.
